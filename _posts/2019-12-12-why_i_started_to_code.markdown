My adventure in coding began with one of my good friends in Chicago, showing me that he could make a program to his job for him. When our employers saw him working on it, they immediately offered him a position to develop it. Simply knowing some basicis of coding and having an idea was enough to drastically transform his career and life. My wife is also involved in the coding world as she is working on both a UX/UI design course and a Software Engineer bootcamp (also with Flatirons), and loving it! She is incredibly driven and wanting to change the world and with these tools at her disposal it may be possible to make a real impact.

Both of these stories have guided me down the path to learning to code to not only better my career, but to better myself as a person. Having a stable job that makes good money is one thing, but with coding I feel like I can find something I truly love. Coding allows one to work almost anywhere, from anywhere, at anytime; and having that kind of freedom is amazing. I like to create things to help people or at least make someone laugh, and having an outlet now is an amazing feeling of freedom. I can't wait to keep on learning and finding my niche in this wonderful world of coding.
